# STAT301 Two-Way ANOVA Project
This project analyzes recycling trends in Minnesota from 1991 to 2017 using a dataset that includes 49,019 entries across 86 counties. The study focuses on two main questions: 1) the difference in mean recycled waste weight between residential and commercial/institutional/industrial (CII) sources, and 2) the differences in mean recycled waste weight across different material categories.

The analysis employs two-way ANOVA to compare mean differences across source type (Residential vs. CII) and material category (Paper, Metal, Glass, Plastic, Hazardous, Other, Organic). The results indicate significant differences in mean recycled waste weights between residential and CII sources, as well as across different material categories.

The interaction between source type and material category also shows significance, suggesting that recycling behaviors are influenced by both the material being recycled and the source type. These findings highlight the need for targeted recycling strategies based on material categories and source types to improve recycling efficiency.

However, the study has limitations, including assumptions of homogeneity of variances and potential confounding variables not accounted for in the analysis. Additionally, the findings are specific to Minnesota and may not be generalizable to other regions.
